  <h1>Amanda's directions</h1>
  <p>I can't express enough how it's really best not to put the
  postcode in the sat nav as it will send you cross country through
  our tiny narrow lanes from the A38 and then again which is about
  20 miles and can be very challenging! If you stick to the main
  roads Iâ€™m directing below, it takes no longer and is a much
  easier journey.</p>
  <p>M5 then A38 Plymouth direction. From A38 Take the
  Dartington/Kingsbridge/Salcombe exit to Totnes Town. As you
  approach Totnes Town you will see the turning at the first
  traffic lights a sign to Kingsbridge. It's approx 12 miles to
  Kingsbridge. Again, donâ€™t sat nav Kingsbridge if you do it will
  try to throw you off into the green lanes and the wilderness, so
  best to stay on the main road and get into Kingsbridge!</p>
  <p>Again no sat nav as youâ€™ll end up going a really narrow route
  that also is by the school and if itâ€™s that time, itâ€™s chaos!</p>
  <p>From Kingsbridge follow signs to Dartmouth direction. That
  takes you down the town towards the Quay still following signs to
  Dartmouth over the roundabout at the bottom of town with the
  estuary on your right.</p>
  <p>After mile or so, you come to a stone arched bridge and
  immediately before it, turn left, the estuary still on your right
  still. Stay on that lane for approx 1.5 miles, it bends and turns
  but just stick with it!!! Eventually after a sharp right bend you
  see a big stone farm on the right, then carry on until you see a
  blue cottage on left (nearly there!) after that, a couple more
  bends you will go up a steep hill. At the top of the hill on
  right you see two pillars with stone balls on them. That is my
  entrance. There are no signs, as I like it to be private. If you
  get very lost call me!! Please park in the first bay on the
  left.</p>
  <p>My phone is always on but signal not always good for me at
  home so try land line if you can't get through. 01548 854545</p>
  <p>I hope you have a safe journey and I look forward to greeting
  you.</p>
