The directory 'dist' contains all the static assets, like images, HTML files etc. The 'manualslideshow' directory contains Elm code which generates the Javascript for the manual slideshow on the homepage. This code can be built by first install Elm, and then running the script at 'manualslideshow/build.sh'. This will generate the Javascript file and put it into the 'dist' directory.

The installation instructions for Elm are at https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html

All the rest of the site is hand-coded directly as HTML, JS or CSS.
