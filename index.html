    <p>Ranscombe Manor House is a luxurious self-catering holiday
    home which can accommodate 14-16 guests if you book the cottage
    as well. The main house sleeps 10-12 guests (with the sofa
    bed).</p>
    <p>Ranscombe Manor House is located in the South Hams area of
    South Devon, 1.5 miles from Kingsbridge and 8 miles from
    Salcombe. Dating back to the 1600s, this property is an
    imposing and comfortable historical manor house hidden in the
    valley, surrounded by 32 acres of its own stunning and tranquil
    countryside, for you to freely enjoy and explore. The Manor can
    only be seen from the air: it is totally hidden so ideal for
    celebrities and people who seek privacy and seclusion.</p>
    <p>Also available here is a beautiful, self-contained,
    self-catering two-bed property, <a href=

    parking area. The views from the rooms and the gardens are
    superb, stretching for miles over open, rolling Devon
    countryside.</p>
